Welcome fellas!

This is where we create a <b>Deep Neural Network (DNN)</b> from scratch!


If you're already familier with the concept, then just go ahead. But if you don't then visit,
https://parthiktalks.blogspot.com/2019/10/neural-networks-in-nutshell-from-scratch.html
to get introduced to Neural Networks and learn how it is created!


Also, you can't play with this directly in my playground and tinker with different parameters or even code itself.
